    Question:   Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers.
                One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array.
                Find these two numbers.

    Input:
    N = 2
    Arr[] = {2, 2}
    Output: 2 1
    Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and smallest positive missing number is 1.

    Basically we can have multiple approaches:
    1.  We can sort the array and then find the missing and repeating number.
        Problem: time complexity will be O(NLogN)
    2.  We can initialize a new array with 0. So when we iterate over the array we can increment the index value of the new array.
        So ultimately the index having 0 as value will be missing and 2 as value will be repeating.
        Problem: time complexity is O(n) but space complexity is also O(n).
    3.  We can iterate over the array and use the absolute value as index and make multiple the value with -1.
        For repeating part, just apply the else statement and check if alreadythe value is negative.
        For missing part, just check if the element is positive. Then just return the index.
